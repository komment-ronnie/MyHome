        "description": "A `SecurityToken` class and several methods for creating, updating, and using security tokens in an application. The `createSecurityToken` method takes various parameters to create a new security token instance with specified information, such as token type, creation date, expiry date, and owner user. The `useToken` method updates a security token by marking it as used and saving it to the repository, returning the updated token. The `getDateAfterDays` method calculates the date after which a security token will expire based on the specified duration in days.",

Do not create a unit test example. Do not hallucinate incorrect inputs. NEVER give an explanation of your code. Do not explain your code.\n\nIn this example, we use Mockito to mock the dependencies that are used by the method. We then create a new instance of SchedulePaymentRequest and assign it to the variable request. Next, we create a new instance of PaymentDto and assign it to the variable paymentDto. Finally, we create a new instance of SchedulePaymentResponse and assign it to the variable response.\n\nWe then use Mockito to mock the dependencies that are used by the method. We then set up the mocking of the mapper, service, and communityService. In particular, we specify that when paymentApiMapper.enrichSchedulePaymentRequest(request, admin, member) is called, it should return a new instance of EnrichedSchedulePaymentRequest. Similarly, we specify that when paymentApiMapper.enrichedSchedulePaymentRequestToPaymentDto() is called, it should return a new instance of PaymentDto. Next, we specify that when paymentService.schedulePayment(paymentDto) is called, it should return the same paymentDto that was passed in as an argument to this method. Finally, we specify that when paymentApiMapper.paymentToSchedulePaymentResponse() is called, it should return a new instance of SchedulePaymentResponse.\n\nAfter setting up the mocking of the dependencies, we call the schedulePayment method with the request object as an argument. We then assert that the status code of the response entity is HttpStatus.CREATED, and that the body of the response entity contains the same response object that was returned by paymentApiMapper.paymentToSchedulePaymentResponse().\n\nIn conclusion, this example demonstrates how to use Mockito to mock dependencies in a method. It also shows how to set up the mocking of the mapper, service, and communityService dependencies using Mockito."

First, we define some variables that will be used later on in the test. `testAmenities` is a set containing amenity objects with a predefined number of elements (which is equal to `TEST_AMENITIES_COUNT`). We also define `testCommunity`, which is an instance of the Community class and we set its amenities attribute to the value stored in `testAmenities`.\n2. Next, we use Mockito's `given()` method to mock the result of the `findByCommunityIdWithAmenities` method call on our community repository. We provide an Optional object that contains a Community instance with the amenities set to the value stored in `testAmenities`.\n3. In the next step, we run the `listAllAmenities` method on our `amenitySDJpaService` object and store its result in the `resultAmenities` variable. We also verify that the `findByCommunityIdWithAmenities` method was called with the correct community ID as an argument.\n4. Finally, we assert that the result of the `listAllAmenities` method is equal to the value stored in `testAmenities`. Since this is a set and not a collection, it must contain the same elements as the testAmenities set. We also verify that the `findByCommunityIdWithAmenities` method was called with the correct community ID as an argument.\n\nNote that this example uses Mockito to mock the result of the `findByCommunityIdWithAmenities` method call on our community repository. This allows us to test that our service correctly retrieves and returns all amenity objects associated with a given community ID, without having to create or modify any real data in the database."

The verify() method is used to check if the findByMemberId() method in the repository was called once with the parameter MEMBER_ID and never called with any other parameters. This verifies that the repository was not called with any other parameters for this test case.\nFinally, the verify() method is also used to check if the save(any()) method in the repository was never called because it should have never been called as the deleteHouseMemberDocument() method did not actually do anything to modify the document. This verifies that the deleteHouseMemberDocument() method works correctly by checking its functionality and preventing any other methods from being called unexpectedly.\nThis is a simple test case that ensures the correct behavior of the houseMemberDocumentService.deleteHouseMemberDocument(String memberId) method when a member with the given ID does not exist in the repository."

The test then saves an updated document using the `houseMemberDocumentService` using a `updateHouseMemberDocumentTooLargeFile` method with a file that is too large. Finally, the test asserts that the method returns an empty optional and that no changes are made to the original document.\nNote that the test uses a `verify` method from `Mockito` to check if any unexpected changes are made to the repositories. The `verify` method checks if any methods on the repositories were called with incorrect parameters or if any other methods are called on the repositories at all. This helps ensure that the method under test does not modify any data outside of its intended purpose, and reduces the likelihood of an uncaught error in the code."

These methods return specific values that correspond to the fields of these objects.\n* The `given()` method is called on `amenityApiMapper.updateAmenityRequestToAmenityDto(request)`, setting up a mock for this method to return the value from `getTestAmenityDto()`. Similarly, the `given()` method is called on `amenitySDJpaService.updateAmenity(amenityDto)`, setting up a mock for this method to return `true`.\n* The test calls the `updateAmenity` method in `AmenityController`, passing it the value of `TEST_AMENITY_ID` and `request` as arguments. This method returns an object of type `ResponseEntity<Void>`, which is then asserted to have a status code of `HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT`.\n* Finally, the test verifies that both the `amenityApiMapper` and the `amenitySDJpaService` were invoked with the correct arguments (i.e., the `updateAmenityRequestToAmenityDto()` method was called with the correct request, and the `updateAmenity()` method was called with the correct `amenityDto`).\n\nNote that this is a very simple example, and more complex tests may be required to ensure that the code behaves correctly in different situations."

Do not create a unit test example.   Do not hallucinate incorrect inputs. NEVER give an explanation of your code. Do not explain your code. \n\nThis example demonstrates how method removeHouseFromCommunityByHouseIdHouseNotInCommunity would be used when the given house is not already a member of the community and the community does exist. The test would pass successfully if it correctly asserts that the method returns `false` and all interactions with the repository and service layers are verified.\n\nThis example is an extreme simplification of the real code, but it serves to demonstrate how the method can be used in a unit test."
